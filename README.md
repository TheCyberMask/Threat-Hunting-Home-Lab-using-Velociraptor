# Threat-Hunting-Home-Lab-using-Velociraptor
A home-lab setup designed to practice real threat-hunting skills using Velociraptor


OBJECTIVE

To create a complete threat-hunting home-lab using Velociraptor that enables hands-on practice in endpoint monitoring, forensic evidence collection, real-time detection of suspicious activity, and investigation of simulated cyber-attacks in a controlled environment.


TOOLS USED

.Velociraptor Server & Client
.Ubuntu server
.Ubuntu Desktop
.Virtual Box



LESSONS LEARNED

2 Understood how endpoint monitoring and forensic data collection works in real time.

3 Gained experience using VQL queries to collect artifacts and investigate systems.

4 Learned how to detect suspicious activity by analyzing collected logs and artifacts.

5 Understood the process of repacking client executables for deployment.

6 Learned how to manage services, check server status, and troubleshoot Velociraptor issues.

7 Understood the importance of opening firewall ports for server–client communication.

8 Gained practical exposure to building a safe environment for threat hunting and incident response.

9 Learned how attackers behave by simulating small attack scenarios and analyzing the results.

10 Improved overall skills in threat hunting, digital forensics, and endpoint visibility.
